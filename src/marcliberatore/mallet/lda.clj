;; ## Overview
;;
;; This namespace provides functions that thinly wrap the MALLET
;; toolkit's LDA topic modeling. Notably, it does not currently wrap
;; any of the tokenizing or other "pipe" based features of MALLET.
;;
;; Topic models are built on sets of documents, and MALLET requires
;; that documents be given an arbitrary id. A (document, id) pair is
;; called an instance, and the topic modeling algorithms run on
;; instance lists. To create a topic model, you must first make an
;; instance list.

;; hence the passing around of the Alphabet object in the functions
;; below.

;; ## Topic Model Wrapper
;;
;; The invocation sequence to create a topic model will
;; look something like:
;;
;;     (let [data [[1 ["a" "little" "lamb"]]
;;                 [2 ["row" "your" "boat"]]]
;;           instance-list (make-instance-list data)]
;;       (lda instance-list))
;;
;; though you probably will load your data from elsewhere.

(defn make-model
  "Return a topic model (ParallelTopicModel) on the given
  instance-list, using the optional parameters if specified. The
  default parameters will run fairly quickly, but will not return
  high-quality topics."
